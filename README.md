# CRUD-with-.net-8-web-api

This project demonstrates a robust implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Web API built using .NET 8, showcasing modern, scalable, and efficient web development practices.

#Key Features:

1. CRUD Operations: Fully functional API endpoints for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on entities.

2. Layered Architecture: Implements clean architecture principles with distinct layers for controllers, services, and data access, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

3. Error Handling: Centralized exception handling middleware for streamlined debugging and production readiness.

4. Data Access: Implements Dapper, ADO.NET, and Entity Framework to interact efficiently with the relational database, showcasing flexibility and best practices for working with stored procedures, which are organized in a dedicated folder (SqlScripts) within the repository.

#Technologies Used:

1. .NET 8: Latest framework for high-performance web APIs.

2. SQL Server: For persistent and reliable data storage (stored procedures).

#Why This Project Stands Out:

This project is designed with a focus on best practices in modern web API development, including a structured approach to code organization, security, and scalability. It's ideal for use in enterprise applications and demonstrates a deep understanding of software engineering principles.
